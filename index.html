        <h2>Back story</h2>
        <p>
          I spend my days looking after protection relays and system
          observability devices (fault recorders, phasor measurement units and
          the like) at SSEN Transmission. I've always had an active interest in
          the energy landscape in the UK. Combined with that, I've had a passing
          interest in programming since my university days. Combining all that
          together, my interest was peaked by

          >
          by Robin Hawkes, and wondered what would be involved in replicating
          Robin's work (upto a point) and extending it to include the full mix
          of generation in the UK. This is the result of these musings.

        <h2>A couple of notes:</h2>
        <p>Data Sources</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Generator Balancing Mechanism Unit and output data is derived from
            the Elexon

              >Insights Solution</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Generator location data is derived from the
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES)</a

            Matching of BMU data to generator location data is done by me...

        </ul>
        <p>
          The data presented are generator outputs as stated in the Physical
          Notice for the current settlement period. This is the closest offering
          from the Elexon API to a "real time" output. Not sure how constraints
          are managed, and something I will explore in future.
        </p>

        <h2>Final thoughts (for now!)</h2>
        <p>
          Please enjoy! Any comments would be appreciated. Future revisions of
          the map may include (time permitting) the ability to examine network
          output during a user selected settlement period.
