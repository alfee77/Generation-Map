            <h3>An extension of an energy experiment.</h3> 
            <p>I spend my days looking after protection relays and 
            system observability devices (fault recorders, phasor measurement units and the like) at SSEN Transmission.
            I've always had an active interest in the energy landscape in the UK. Combined with that, I've had a 
            passing interest in programming since my university days. Combining all that together, my interest was
            peaked by <a href="https://renewables-map.robinhawkes.com/">GB Renewables Map</a> by Robin Hawkes, and 
            wondered what would be involved in replicating Robin's work (upto a point) and extending it to include 
            the full mix of generation in the UK. This is the result of these musings.</p>

            <h3>A couple of notes:</h3>
            <p>Data Sources</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generator Balancing Mechanism Unit and output data is derived from the Elexon <a href="https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/">Insights Solution</a></li>
                <li>Generator location data is derived from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digest-of-uk-energy-statistics-dukes">Digest of 
                    UK Energy Statistics (DUKES)</a>, specifically table 5.11</li>
                <li>Matching of BMU data to generator location data is done by me...</li>
                <li>Maps by maplibre and maptiler</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The data presented are generator outputs as stated in the Physical Notice for the current settlement 
            period. This is the closest offering from the Elexon API to a "real time" output. Not sure how constraints are managed, 
            and something I will explore in future.</p>

            <h3>Final thoughts (for now!)</h3>
            <p>Please enjoy! Any comments would be appreciated. Future revisions of the map may include (time permitting) the ability to examine network 
            output during a user selected settlement period.</p>
